# Infinite-Combinatorial-Game-Sums-ISEF

## Project Overview

This repository investigates the determinacy of Lipparini's infinite combinatorial Nim sums through AI-driven probabilistic simulations and mathematical analysis.

**Research question:**  
Can we prove determinacy in Lipparini's infinite combinatorial Nim sums using AI probabilistic simulations?

By simulating large datasets of game positions and applying machine learning models, the project seeks patterns and empirical evidence supporting (or challenging) determinacy in these infinite games.
